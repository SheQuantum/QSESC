A comprehensive whitepaper and an initial, earnest spark on the need for universalization and standardization efforts in Quantum Software Engineering

The Quantum Software Engineering Standardization Council (QSESC), established by SheQuantum, convenes to advocate for the development of a standardized, universal approach in quantum software engineering with the support of global experts. We strongly beleive that this document would be the initial spark towards efforts in making QSWE hardware agnostic and programming language agnostic.

𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: The council's first goal is to soon publish a comprehensive whitepaper document on “Universalization of Quantum Software Engineering” emphasizing the criticality of standardization in this field. This document will be disseminated for the global quantum community through SheQuantum and further will be shared with key standards organizations including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ISO - International Organization for Standardization, and IEEE.

We're more than proud to pioneer this important revolution with esteemed quantum experts from across the world. Cheers to the QSWE revolution!
